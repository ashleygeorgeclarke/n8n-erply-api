### Erply API

Any calls to the [https://*.erply.com/api](https://learn-api.erply.com/requests) endpoint are handled by the Erply API node.

### Erply Service

All service APIs (PIM, inventory etc) are handled by Erply Service.

The Endpoint Path Select options are dynamically fetched from the respective service api swagger doc json files. The use of this is simply a convenience and is not strictly necessary to use.

If the path contains a replacable components ({ids} etc), use .replace("{ids}", "myvalue") to set the desired values.

### Erply Trigger

[These webhooks](https://wiki.erply.com/en/article/760-introduction) will be dynamically created/destroyed, so there's no need to create them manually before use.

## Limitations

All authenticated requests get a new sessionKey and are not reused even though an expiry is provided. Erply returns status code 400 when a sessionKey is expired. A current limitation of n8n requires a 401 response to trigger a token refresh.

ErplyService should use [getServiceEndpoints](https://learn-api.erply.com/new-apis) as an input to list the correct endpoint base URLs for your account code. According to Erply, these service endpoints can change without prior notice.
